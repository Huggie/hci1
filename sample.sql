(1, 'The Case of the Guara or Centerboard', 'There is a certain amount of irony in the fact that Thor Heyerdahl, who was not a sailor, proved that some watercraft used by man a very long time ago, were actually more seaworthy than the ones that brought Europeans to America. When the Conquistadores came with their highly unseaworthy ships, they found extremely seaworthy rafts off the Andean coast. These rafts could, for example, land unharmed through the surf, and could carry Indian merchants and their whole extended families, along with 20 tons or more of cargo on board. The Spaniards recorded that the Incas remembered times when large organized flotillas of rafts would set out on direct exploring expeditions to very remote islands. But established academics, especially in the 20th Century, are mostly convinced “isolationists” (a kind of hysteria which asserts that technologies are invented separately around the world, without their diffusion by travelling men). Thus, the accepted view is either to deny that these rafts existed, or to say that if they did exist, they could have been used for short voyages only, because gossip had it that dry balsa gets waterlogged quickly and sinks. And since the gossip fits with the ideology that man is like a little monkey which does not wander very far away from its mother, the gossip got a lot of mileage.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, such rafts did exist, although their most brilliant aspect, the function of the guaras, or centerboards, was not understood until much later by the Europeans who saw them used on the rafts. For centerboards were unknown in Europe, and were, in fact, not adopted (and even then, just as a single centerboard) until the 1870s. (The author’s grandfather, seen in the photo, who fished the Scheldt in Zeeland, in the early 1900s, used lee boards, as did everyone else at the time.)\r\n\r\nExplorer Thor Heyerdahl did not know how to use the guaras, although he knew from sketches that they existed, and so he put them on his raft—without knowing their true function. As for the professors who said the rafts could not work, or did not exist, they were not the right ones to ask for the function of the guaras or centerboards.', 'Jody Foster', '2001', 'Penguin Books', '2009-10-27 00:00:00'),
(5, 'Should The Law Of Gravity Be Repealed?', 'An iron curtain divides the subjects of gravity and electrodynamics, in today’s academically accepted versions of physics. Those attempting to cross it will risk the intellectual equivalent of machine-gun fire. Beyond, lie even more serious obstacles which come, not from outside, but from within the mind of the investigator. To get at the source of those self-imposed shackles, requires that we go beyond the bounds of what is today defined as “physics,” into matters usually classified as philosophical, or metaphysical. In doing so, we cannot avoid noticing that there are two schools in physical science, each one so distinct from from the other as to constitute two entirely different domains. It is the unfortunate aspect of our modern legacy that most, even among well-educated scientists, are unaware even of the existence of such a distinction. Yet, if the real history of physics of the 19th century were known, most of what passes as teaching of fundamental topics in that discipline today, would be shown to be, in the best of cases, misdirected, in the worst, willful fraud.\r\n\r\nWe know of no better way to correct this deficit than to present this review of the conceptual history of 19th Century electrodynamics. We have two purposes. First, to provide the reader with an introduction to the mostly unknown electrodynamic theory of André-Marie Ampère, and his successors—this, as a necessary aid to understanding our feature article on the subject of anti-gravity by the distinguished French research scientist, Dr. Rémi Saumont. Second, by exposing a crucial aspect of the suppressed history of gravity, electricity, and magnetism, to address the deeper problem of method holding back science today.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the matter before us, begins with the hypothesis and experimental validation of the Ampère angular force. Before the discovery by Oersted and Ampère of the effective equivalence of a closed current and a magnet, it appeared that the pairwise forces between bodies were governed by the same law of universal gravitation, which Johannes Kepler had first noted in his 1609 New Astronomy.1 At the time in question, 1819-1821, three known phenomena appeared to behave according to the assumption that the force between two bodies was determined according to the inverse square of their distance of separation. Apart from gravitation, these were the phenomena of electrostatic, and magnetic attraction and repulsion, investigated especially by Coulomb and Poisson.\r\n\r\nIn all three cases, there was some question as to the perfect validity of the inverse-square assumption. In the case of magnetism, the impossibility of separating the two opposite poles, made exact measurement of the pairwise relationship of one magnet to another always inexact. This problem of the existence of a “third body” did not entirely go away, even in the case of the most carefully observed of these phenomena, gravitation.', 'Matt Damon', '1985', 'The Publisher', '2009-10-27 00:00:00'),
(3, 'Violin Building and the World of Harmonic Sound', '"A beauty of sound, which knows no bounds," is how a luthier once described the tone of the old Italian (and Tyrolese) violins. And, in fact, these old violins embody a concept of instrument-building, which culminated in the great masterpieces of Antonio Stradivari, which can fill great concert halls without any effort, and can be heard over the entire symphony orchestra. Their richness of tone ranges from majestic fortissimo majestoso, to the sad lament of an andante molto grave, up to the outburst of joy scherzo prestissimo. The only other instrument that can be compared to them, is the trained human singing voice. Yet all these tones come from a little wooden box about 35-37cm long for the violin, 42cm for the viola, and 74-78cm for the cello.\r\n\r\nWhen you look a little more closely at these handmade masterpieces, you can recognize that this kind of instrument is a triumph of both acoustics and physics. There are many myths in circulation about these "fabulous instruments." Were the luthiers of old initiated into some secret of the acoustics of physics, which we no longer know today; is there a secret kind of wood, or art of varnishing, which makes all the difference in the sound; or, is there some other kind of secret, relating to how the wood is cut, which had been carefully protected and was lost after the death of Stradivari?\r\n\r\nThere are still many unanswered questions today about the construction of the violin family (violin, viola, and cello, which all have the same underlying principle of construction), especially after the death of Stradivari, when the great art of creating such wonderful works sank, further and further, into oblivion–and the wildest speculations and most bitter disputes arose. Most of these discussions, however, quite ignore the key question. The Renaissance, the time that saw the birth of this family of instruments, was a time of many discoveries, not only in music and instrument-building, but also in painting, the plastic arts, architecture, and machine building. The most significant and many-sided artist and scientist of this time was, without question, Leonardo da Vinci.\r\n\r\nThe situation in the world of music, and especially regarding musical instruments at the time that we call the Golden Renaissance, provides a number of substantial reasons for assuming that the building of the violin was an invention. The idea for building such an instrument must have sprung from the new discoveries of the Renaissance–above all, from Leonardo da Vinci’s investigations into tonality and sound.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Pythagoreans were already acquainted with the paradox, that man recognizes only a few intervals as harmonic, and these intervals, which are heard as harmonic, are created on a stringed instrument by placing the fingers with different spacing between them in each different key. Here, we will pursue this idea somewhat further.', 'Steve Wright', '1993', 'Amiga Weekly', '2009-10-27 00:00:00'),
(4, 'Anti-Gravity: Myth or Reality', 'Escaping the attraction of the Earth is a very old aspiration. In literature and inscriptions on ancient monuments, the story is told of winged creatures, or men that can fly. Mercury, the messenger of the Greek gods, was represented with wings on his fee¸, and even back in the time of ancient Egypt we find images of winged figures, such as those preserved in bas-relief in the Department of Egyptian Antiquities at the Louvre in Paris.\r\n\r\nCloser to the present, especially since the beginning of the 17th Century, many stories (more or less mythical) and proposals have appeared, some of which prefigured the real “flying machines” that came later. Often the question was not just voyages in the air, but up into space, as, for example, in the novel by the Englishman, Godwin, The Man in the Moon, which appears to have inspired Savinien de Cyrano, known as Bergerac (1619-1655), in his stories “Voyage to the Moon” and “The Comic History of the States and Empires of the Sun.” Remarkably, Cyrano speaks explicitly of the propulsion of one of these machines by rockets.\r\n\r\nA century later, at Marseilles in 1806, the artisan Claude Ruggieri accomplished the practical application of this means of propulsion, on a scale far surpassing that of the fireworks known since the time of ancient China. By means of a necklace of rockets, Ruggieri succeeded in lifting a live sheep more than 600 feet into the air, bringing it to a soft landing with a parachute.\r\n\r\nHowever, as such accomplishments did no more than utilize Archimedes’ buoyancy principle for the medium of air (in the case of the baloonists), or the principle of action and reaction (in the case of rockets), the fight against weight had only succeeded in counterbalancing the effects, without modifying them a bit. The principle of the airplane—a craft “heavier than air”—so widely in use today, was not an exception to the general rule. Thus, even today, we do not know how to fight against weight, except by opposing to it forces of another nature, the which cannot be done without posing some delicate problems of a dimensional type, as we will see below.\r\n\r\nWhat differentiates the mode of propulsion of a rocket from all the others (both the lighter- and heavier-than-air vehicles) is that it works in a vacuum—even better than in the air. So, almost 50 years ago, the birth and development of astronautics took place, which, even at the end of the first 40 years of this century, seemed more like science fiction than reality.\r\n\r\nAs experience teaches, the dreams of pioneers are often realized much more rapidly than their contemporaries could have imagined. Our present time abounds in facts of this kind. This was the case for radar, antibiotics, nuclear power plants, the transistor, television, intercontinental missiles, the high-speed train (TGV), organ transplants, computers, the genome, and so on.\r\n\r\nOn cursory examination, there seems no limit to the speed of the technological revolution, which tends to take on an exponential character.\r\n\r\nYet, there remains an area, in addition to that of controlled nuclear fusion, in which man’s ingenuity seems to have been dancing around for the last 30 years: the realm of interplanetary space travel—which, at the beginning, had taken off with fireworks (both figuratively and literally). In the 1960s, we moved quickly from the rudimentary Sputnik to a trip to the Moon, and even, by use of robotics, to the confines of the solar system. But, today, we still use the same techniques, which are so costly that it is not even financially possible to repeat the accomplishments of the past, and, for example, to colonize the Moon.', 'Steve Ballmer', '2008', 'Microsoft', '2009-10-27 00:00:00'),
(6, 'Russian Scientists Replicate ''Impossible'' Mitogenetic Radiation', 'A heated debate recently erupted among biologists and physicists at Moscow State University, about a series of experiments by A.B. Burlakov and his collaborators, demonstrating nonlinear interactions between living organisms, ostensibly mediated by electromagnetic radiation alone. The results of the experiments were so striking and unexpected to many of the Moscow biologists, that they were initially dismissed as ''impossible.'' A number of the skeptics tried the experiments themselves, and were astonished to find exactly the effects reported by Burlakov et al.\r\n\r\nIn fact, back in the 1920s, the famous Russian biophysicist Alexander Gurwitsch had already established beyond any reasonable doubt, that living cells and tissues generate an extremely weak, yet biologically active, form of electromagnetic radiation, in particular in the ultraviolet range; and that the presence of this radiation is somehow intimately connected with the nature of living processes themselves.\r\n\r\nGurwitsch was led to his experimental demonstration of what he called "mitogenetic radiation" in a lawful and rigorous way, as a by-product of his attempts to hypothesize a universal biophysical principle, the which (among other things) would encompass the paradoxical, but otherwise undeniable correlations between events of cell division (mitosis) and other events occurring in widely separated locations within a living organism.\r\n\r\n		\r\nlow-level luminescence of cucumber seedlings 		Doing the impossible: Shown here is the low-level luminescence of cucumber seedlings, in photons per second, observed in the laboratory of Fritz Popp, between 250 and 500 seconds in the course of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: Fritz Popp, 1985. ''Principles of Quantum Biology As Demonstrated by Ultraweak Photon Emission from Living Cells,'' International Journal of Fusion Energy, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Oct.).\r\n		\r\nGurwitsch''s work, like that of his great Ukrainian-Russian scientific contemporary Vernadsky, was a direct outgrowth of the work of Louis Pasteur, and ultimately of Kepler and Leibniz. Exactly for that reason, it was systematically suppressed; both in the West—where the Rockefeller Foundation directly targetted Gurwitsch''s and related work from the late 1920s on, as a threat to its promotion of reductionist "molecular biology"—and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in the Soviet Union itself.\r\n\r\nThe oligarchical effort to shut down Gurwitsch, and other branches of the Leibnizian/Pasteurian thrust in biology and medicine in particular, went hand-in-hand with the promotion of fascist eugenics policies, both in the crude form of the Harriman-sponsored Nazi "race hygiene," and the retooled, purportedly more "objective" and "scientific" version, now being propagated under the cover of the "human genome project" and the marriage of molecular biology with the doctrines of information theory and so-called "computer science." In fact, there has been no interruption in two centuries of British-centered efforts to use "biological theories" as a prime vehicle for propagating fascist doctrines, policies, and movements. The swindle of "artificial intelligence" and the now-booming pseudo-scientific discipline of "artificial life," amount to the same thing: the attempt to eliminate human cognition, to eliminate the concept of Man in the living image of God, and to propagate a bestial concept of society. . . .', 'Nikolai Z', '1967', 'Stalin Indvstry', '2009-10-27 00:00:00'),
(7, 'Computers and Education in America', 'In the last decade, computers have invaded every aspect of education, from kindergarten through college. The figures show that schools have spent over two billion dollars installing two million new computers. Recently, with the explosive increase of sites on the Internet, computers have taken another dramatic rise. In just five years, the number of Internet hosts has skyrocketed from 2 million to nearly 20 million. It is not uncommon for 6th graders to surf the Net, design their own home pages, and e-mail their friends or strangers they have "met" on the Web. Computer literacy is a reality for many junior high students and most high school students.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this technological explosion, we might well stop and ask some key questions. Is computer technology good or bad for education? Are students learning more or less? What, exactly, are they learning? And who stands to benefit from education''s current infatuation with computers and the Internet?\r\n\r\nIn the debate over the virtues of computers in education, the technological optimists think that computers and the Internet are ushering us into the next literacy revolution, a change as profound as Gutenberg''s invention of the printing press. In contrast, a much smaller but growing number of critics believe that cyberspace is not the ideal classroom. I agree with the critics. If you consider your own experience, you''ll agree that the benefits of computer literacy are at best wildly overrated. At their worst, computers and the Internet pander to the short attention spans and the passive viewing habits of a young television generation.\r\n\r\nThe technological optimists sing a siren song of an enchanted new land where the educational benefits of computers and the Internet are boundless. First, they boast that children can now access information on every conceivable subject. If little Eva or little Johnny wants to learn about far-away cultures, they can access sites from their own homes that will teach them about the great languages and cultures of the world. Second, these starry-eyed optimists warble about how the Internet has created a truly democratic space, where all children--rich, poor, black, white, and brown--have equal access to information and education. Third, they claim that computers will allow students to have e-mail conversations with experts on any subject around the world. No longer will students be limited by their own classroom, their teacher, or their environment. Distance learning is the wave of the future, and classrooms will become obsolete or at least optional. In the words of John Sculley, former CEO of Apple Computer, the new technologies have created an "avalanche of personal creativity and achievement" and they have given students the "ability to explore, convey, and create knowledge as never before." Children who used to hate going to school will now love to learn to read and write, to do math and science. They will voluntarily spend hours learning on the Web instead of being bored to death by endless books and stodgy teachers.\r\n\r\nSound too good to be true? Let''s examine these claims, one by one. First, promoters of computer learning are endlessly excited about the quantity of information available on the Internet. The reality, however, is quite a different story. If you''ve worked on the Internet, you know that finding and retrieving information from a Web site can sometimes be tedious and time consuming. And once you find a site, you have no idea whether the information will be valuable. Popular search engines such as Yahoo! are inefficient at finding relevant information, unless you just want to buy a book on Amazon.com or find a street map for Fargo, North Dakota. Information is definitely available on the Web, but the problem is finding relevant, reliable, and non-commercial information.\r\n\r\nNext, the optimists claim that the Internet is truly a democratic space with equal access for everyone. Again, the reality falls short. First, access to an Internet provider at home costs over a hundred dollars a month, once you add up service and long distance fees. And then there''s the technology barrier--not every person has the skills to navigate the Web in any but the most superficial way. Equal access is still only a theoretical dream, not a current reality.\r\n\r\nFinally, computers do allow students to expand their learning beyond the classroom, but the distance learning is not a utopia. Some businesses, such as Hewlett Packard, do have mentoring programs with children in the schools, but those mentoring programs are not available to all students. Distance learning has always been a dream of administrators, eager to figure out a cheaper way to deliver education. They think that little Eva and Johnny are going to learn about Japanese culture or science or algebra in the evening when they could be talking with their friends on the phone or watching television. As education critic Neil Postman points out, these administrators are not imagining a new technology but a new kind of child: "In [the administrator''s] vision, there is a confident and typical sense of unreality. Little Eva can''t sleep, so she decides to learn a little algebra? Where does little Eva come from? Mars?" Only students from some distant planet would prefer to stick their nose in a computer rather than watch TV or go to school and be with their friends.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these drawbacks are other problems with computers in education. There is the nasty issue of pornography and the rampant commercialism on the Internet. Schools do not want to have their students spend time buying products or being exposed to pornography or pedophiles. Second, the very attractiveness of most Web sites, with their color graphics and ingenious links to other topics, promotes dabbling and skimming. The word "surfing" is appropriate, because most sites encourage only the most surface exploration of a topic. The Internet thus accentuates what are already bad habits for most students: Their short attention spans, their unwillingness to explore subjects in depth, their poor reading and evaluation skills. Computers also tend to isolate students, to turn them into computer geeks who think cyberspace is actually real. Some students have found they have a serious and addictive case of "Webaholism," where they spend hours and hours on the computer at the expense of their family and friends. Unfortunately, computers tend to separate, not socialize students. Finally, we need to think about who has the most to gain or lose from computers in the schools. Are administrators getting more students "taught" for less money? Are big companies training a force of computer worker bees to run their businesses? Will corporate CEO''s use technology to isolate and control their employees?\r\n\r\nIn short, the much ballyhooed promise of computers for education has yet to be realized. Education critic Theodore Roszak has a warning for us as we face the brave new world of computer education:\r\n\r\nLike all cults, this one has the intention of enlisting mindless allegiance and acquiescence. People who have no clear idea of what they mean by information or why they should want so much of it are nonetheless prepared to believe that we live in an Information Age, which makes every computer around us what the relics of the True Cross were in the Age of Faith: emblems of salvation.\r\n\r\nI think if you examine your own experience with computers, you''ll agree that the cult of computers is still an empty promise for most students. Computers, the Internet, and the Web will not magically educate students. It still must be done with reading, study, good teaching, and social interaction. Excellence in education can only be achieved the old fashioned way--students must earn it.', 'Stern John', '1995', 'Bolton Books', '2009-10-27 00:00:00');
